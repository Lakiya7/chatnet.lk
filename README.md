**Secure Coding Practices**
To maintain the integrity and security of the application, we adhere to best practices in secure coding:
  •	Input Validation: All inputs are validated on the server-side to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  •	Session Security: Use of secure session cookies and regeneration of session IDs to prevent session hijacking.
  •	Access Controls: Implementation of role-based access controls to ensure users can only access appropriate features.
  •	Encryption: Utilization of AES for message encryption and secure transmission protocols to protect data in transit.
