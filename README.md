**Installation**

# Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/Lakiya7/chatnet.lk.git

# Navigate to the project directory:
    cd chatnet

# Set up the Database:

  Create a new MySQL database named chatigniter
  Export the chatigniter.sql located in db Folder
  mysql -u username -p chatnetdb < path/to/chatigniter.sql

# Configure the Application

  Navigate to the app/config directory.
  Copy the config.sample.php to config.php and edit it to set your database credentials and other environment-specific configurations.

# Configure Apache

  Set up an Apache virtual host to point to the public directory of the cloned repository.
  Ensure that mod_rewrite is enabled for pretty URLs.

  nano /etc/httpd/conf.d/site1.conf
 
  ```
<VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName Chatnet.lk
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/Chat_Net

**Secure Coding Practices**
To maintain the integrity and security of the application, we adhere to best practices in secure coding:
  - Input Validation: All inputs are validated on the server-side to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
  - Session Security: Use of secure session cookies and regeneration of session IDs to prevent session hijacking.
  -	Access Controls: Implementation of role-based access controls to ensure users can only access appropriate features.
  -	Encryption: Utilization of AES for message encryption and secure transmission protocols to protect data in transit.
